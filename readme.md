# Simple local LLM interface demo

## Setup

use the following code to start your virtual environment:

```
python -m venv llm_env
source llm_env/bin/activate
```

then install the requirements:

```
pip install transformers torch gradio
```

# Usage
python app.py to start the interface. 
It will take some time for things to spin up the first time you run a model.

Uncomment what you want to use, and comment out the rest.
